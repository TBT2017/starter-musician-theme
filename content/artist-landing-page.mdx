<p>Songs and story very often go hand in hand. Just as a good book transports its reader to another place, a great song will bring the listener in and make them a part of the picture being painted. For Lindsey and Seth, aka The Bluebird Two, music is the very foundation of their personal love story. After connecting through Seth's solo music projects, the two bluebirds now create folk-like tales with themes on life, love, loss, and the mystery of what's next.</p>
<p>"Musically, I'd think of us as sort of DIY-Folk-Nugrass-Punk-Acoustic Rock...basically whatever we feel like being at the time." says Seth, who plays acoustic guitar and a homemade kickdrum/suitcase. His raspy, raw vocals combine with Lindsey's smooth, silky sweet melodies to create a refreshing balance.</p>
<p>The bluebirds seem to find their niche in the odd, crafted, and organic, and hope that you will raise your voice to join in their song!</p>
